## CODENAME: CAPITALOPS
## Operational Blueprint
Layered on Coral8
## 1. SYSTEM INTENT
CapitalOps is not a standalone platform.
It is:
A capital + governance operating layer built on top of Coral8’s execution backbone.
Coral8 handles:
● Task tracking
## ● Workflow
● Internal documentation
● Execution data capture
CapitalOps handles:
● Investor alignment
● Deal distribution
● Governance interpretation
● Vendor & maintenance visibility
● Structured reporting
That separation must remain clean.
- SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (3 Modules)
## Module 1: Capital Engine
## Purpose:
Curated deal distribution and investor transparency.
## Core Capabilities:
● Investor profile management
● Deal tagging
● Rule-based matching
● Sponsor-approved distribution
● Engagement tracking
● Allocation tracking
● Investor transparency dashboard

## Module 2: Execution Control
## Purpose:
Translate raw Coral8 data into governance-level clarity.
## Core Capabilities:
● Milestone rollups
● Budget vs actual summary
● Risk flag triggers
● Delay explanations
● Variance reporting
● Governance event log
## Module 3: Asset & Vendor Control
## Purpose:
Operational discipline and asset protection.
## Core Capabilities:
● Vendor login portal
● Invoice uploads
● COI upload
● Work order tracking
● Change order submission
● Maintenance tracking
● Asset health rollups
- DATA MODEL SPECIFICATION (Julian Must Lock This First)

If this schema is sloppy, the system collapses later.

## 3. Deal
## Fields:
● DealID
● ProjectID (FK)
● CapitalRequired

● AssetID (FK)
## ● Type
## ● Priority
## ● Cost
● CapExFlag
## ● Status
● CompletionDate
● PhotoURL
This is enough for our MVP.
We should not expand beyond this.
## 4. ROLE & PERMISSION STRUCTURE
Implement strict role separation.
## Roles
## Sponsor Admin
● Full access
● Can create deals
● Approve investor distribution
● See all modules
## Project Manager
● Update milestones
● Log delay explanations
● View execution dashboard
● Cannot alter capital engine
## General Contractor
● Confirm milestone completion
● Submit change orders
● Upload documentation
● No investor visibility

## Vendor
● Upload invoices
● Submit work completion
● View own work orders only
Investor (Tier 1)
● View matched deals
● Access deal truth room
● View governance summaries
● Submit allocation request
Priority Investor (Tier 2)
● Early access
● Structured allocation input
● Enhanced reporting view
Permissions must be enforced at database level, not just UI.
- SYSTEM FLOW (Data Movement)
Module 3 (Vendor + Maintenance)
## ⬇
Module 2 (Execution Control)
## ⬇
Module 1 (Capital Engine)
Operational truth
→ Governance interpretation
→ Investor transparency
No direct vendor → investor view.
Everything must flow upward.


## 6. MVP BUILD PLAN (30–60 DAY EXECUTION)
We compress intelligently.
Phase 1 (Days 1–15)
## Lock Schema
Integrate Coral8 API
## Build:
● Investor profile UI
● Deal tagging UI
● Basic matching logic
● Sponsor console
● Basic project dashboard
## Deliverable:
Internal working prototype for 1 live project.
Phase 2 (Days 16–30)
## Build:
● Risk flag logic
● Milestone auto-progress calculation
● Budget variance rollups
● Governance log
● Investor-facing view toggle
● Soft commit tracking
## Deliverable:
Investor demo ready.
Phase 3 (Days 31–60)
## Build:
● Vendor portal login
● Invoice upload
● Work order system
● SLA tagging
● Asset health rollups
● Maintenance dashboard
## Deliverable:
Full internal operational control system.

## 7. WHAT SHOULD NOT BE BUILT
● Full accounting engine
● Full property management system
● AI recommendation engine
● Marketplace functionality
● Public deal directory
## ● Tokenization
● CRM replacement
Scope discipline is survival.
## 8. MVP SUCCESS METRICS
We know it works when:
● Investor conversations are shorter
● Allocation happens faster
● PM explanations are structured
● Vendor discipline improves
● No milestone drifts silently
● You stop chasing capital, and start selecting it
## 9. FUNDING POSITIONING
CapitalOps is not a speculative SaaS.
It is:
Infrastructure supporting active real estate development.
Funding narrative:
● Reduces capital raise friction
● Increases execution discipline
● Protects downside risk
● Improves repeat capital probability
● Scales across pipeline
You are not selling software.
You are building capital infrastructure.


## CAPITALOPS
Phase 1 Architecture: 3 Projects, Scalable to 10+
Built on Coral8
Lean but expandable
## I. DESIGN PRINCIPLE
Build for:
- 3 concurrent active projects
- 1 portfolio
- 1 sponsor entity
- 20–50 investors
- 10–30 vendors
But structure database as if 10+ is coming.
## Meaning:
Multi-project aware
Not multi-tenant yet
No overengineering
II. SYSTEM STRUCTURE (Lean but Expandable)
## Hierarchy:
## Portfolio (1)
## └ Asset
└ Project (3 max active initially)
## └ Deal
## └ Allocation
Everything gets a PortfolioID.
Even if only one exists.
That prevents rewrite later.



## III. WHAT TO BUILD NOW
Core Entities (Lean Version)
## Portfolio
## Asset
## Project
## Deal
## Investor
## Allocation
## Milestone
## Vendor
WorkOrder
RiskFlag
That’s it.
Do not add CapitalLedger yet.
Do not build portfolio heatmaps yet.
Do not build cross-asset vendor scoring yet.
Add placeholders only.
## IV. MODULE STRUCTURE (PHASE 1)
Module 1: Capital Engine (Lean)
Must support:
- Investor profiles
- Deal tagging
- Matching logic
- Sponsor-approved distribution
- Allocation tracking
- Investor transparency dashboard
## But:
No tier automation yet.
No advanced scoring yet.
No cross-portfolio analytics yet.
Just structured alignment.




Module 2: Execution Control (Lean)
Pull from Coral8.
Must show:
- Milestone progress
- Budget vs actual
- Risk flags
- Delay explanations
- Draw status
Standardized milestone categories from day one.
Even if you only have 3 projects.
This is key.

Module 3: Asset & Vendor Control (Lean)
Must support:
- Vendor login
- Invoice upload
- COI upload
- Work order tracking
- CapEx vs OpEx classification
- Basic SLA tagging
Do not build:
Vendor scoring engine yet.
Portfolio vendor comparison yet.
## V. BUILD FOR SCALE (BUT HIDE FOR NOW)
Should be done:
- Include PortfolioID in all tables
- Include ProjectID foreign keys everywhere
- Include role-based permission structure
- Structure risk flags as category-based, not custom per project


This allows:
Scaling to 10 projects later without schema rewrite.
## VI. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (REALISTIC)
## Phase 1 (0–30 Days)
## Build:
- Multi-project aware schema
- Investor profile + matching
- Deal truth room
- Execution dashboard
- Vendor upload portal
- Risk flag logic
- Role permissions
Support 3 live projects fully.
## Phase 2 (30–60 Days)
## Enhance:
- Portfolio summary dashboard
- Cross-project capital summary
- Basic vendor performance rollup
- Allocation history tracking
Still lean.
Still controlled.

## Phase 3 (60–90 Days)
Optional scale layer:
- Priority tier automation
- Allocation scoring logic
- Portfolio risk heatmap
- Cross-project vendor analytics
Only if needed.


## VII. WHY THIS APPROACH IS CORRECT
If you build for 10+ today:
You stall.
You overbuild.
You introduce complexity you won’t use.
If you build for 3 but architect for 10:
You move.
You launch.
You generate credibility.
You iterate intelligently.
This is disciplined scaling.
## VIII. WHAT YOU MUST DECIDE NOW
## Questions:
- Will Coral8 remain the single source of execution truth?
If yes, CapitalOps reads, not duplicates.
- Are you storing documents in Coral8 or separate storage?
- Will investors log into CapitalOps directly or receive static view links initially?
- Are you using 506(b) or 506(c) structures for offerings?
That affects distribution logic.
These questions  should be Answered before the build.
